    "The ageing population in any countries is a challenge. Many countries in the world are facing this unavoidable social problem. Ageing population occurs when the median age of a country grows caused by the higher life expectancy and decline in the birth rate or/and fertility rate. The ageing population has some negative effects for a country. First, it will decrease the laboring population of a country which may make the owners of enterprise consider moving their factory to another country having more working population. Second, the proportion about medical expenses for aged people in social sources allocation will increase, and that will increase the financial burden of a country. Additionally, as we discussed in the first result, the decline in working population will also cause immigration problem.\n",
